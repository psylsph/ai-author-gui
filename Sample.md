# Summer Storm

## Story Concept
A pair of estranged lovers reunite in a coastal town as a tropical storm rolls in. The story explores reconciliation, trust, and the tension between safety and adventure.

## Desired Tone
- Lush, sensory prose that highlights the charged atmosphere.
- Character-driven beats with emotional honesty.
- Occasional flashes of humor to break the tension.

## Must-Have Moments
1. A tense meeting under the boardwalk as thunder clouds gather.
2. A power outage dinner lit only by candles and lightning.
3. A climactic rescue during the height of the storm surge.

## Characters
- **Maya Castillo**: A marine biologist chasing a coral bloom; pragmatic but secretly sentimental.
- **Eli Warren**: Runs the tide-worn family marina; intuitive, stubborn, still carrying old regrets.
- _Gus_: Eli's aging labrador who senses every change in barometric pressure.

## Themes to Emphasize
> Storms reveal the fractures as much as they cleanse them.
> Home is a place you choose, not just inherit.

## Style Requests
```text
Keep point-of-view limited to Maya and Eli.
Alternate chapters between their perspectives.
End on a hopeful note without tying every loose thread.
```

## Chapter Targets
- Chapter 1: Maya returns, confronts the past, hints of the coming storm.
- Chapter 2: Eli grapples with expectations, shows the marina's fragility.
- Chapter 3: The storm hits; both are forced to work together.
- Chapter 4: Aftermath, choices about future paths.
